# Assignment Operators:

Assignment operators are used to assign value to a variable. The left side operand of the assignment operator is a variable and the right side operand of the assignment operator is a value. The value on the right side must be of the same data type as the variable on the left side otherwise the compiler will raise an error.

Different types of assignment operators are shown below:

# 1.  “=”

This is the simplest assignment operator. This operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.

### Example:# 

```
    a = 10;
    b = 20;
    ch = 'y';

```

# 2. “+=”
   This operator is the combination of the ‘+’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first adds the current value of the variable on left to the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

### Example:# 

```
    (a += b) can be written as (a = a + b)
    If initially value stored in a is 5. Then (a += 6) = 11.

```

# 3. “-=”
   This operator is a combination of ‘-‘ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first subtracts the value on the right from the current value of the variable on left and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

### Example:

```
    (a -= b) can be written as (a = a - b)
    If initially value stored in a is 8. Then (a -= 6) = 2.
```

# 4. “*=”
   This operator is the combination of the ‘+’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first adds the current value of the variable on left to the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

### Example:

```
    (a *= b) can be written as (a = a * b)
    If initially, the value stored in a is 5. Then (a *= 6) = 30.
```

# 5. “/=”
   This operator is a combination of the ‘/’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first divides the current value of the variable on left by the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

### Example:

```
    (a /= b) can be written as (a = a / b)
    If initially, the value stored in a is 6. Then (a /= 2) = 3.
```

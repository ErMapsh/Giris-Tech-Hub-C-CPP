# Bitwise Opearator : bitwise opearator is used to work with bits.

if we want to work with bits , we have to know number system.


# Number system:
There are 4 type of number system:
### 1.Decimal number: 
- the decimal number system contain 10 digit from 0 to 9
- is base 10
- (123)
       10


### Octal Number: 
- octal number contain 8 digit from 0 to 7;
- so the base of octal is 8;
- (123)
       8

### Hexa Decimal number:
- HexaDecimal number contain 16digit from 0 to 15
- so the base is 16
- (12AF)
        16

### Binary number: 
- Binary number contain only 1 and 0;
- so base of binary is 2.
- (1010101)
           2


## Note: Bitwise number always works with binary number
- if we give any value to bitwise operator, it will convert first into bits.
- if we want to work with bitwise operator we have to know the number system conversion.

# Logical Operators:

Logical Operators are used to combine two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition in consideration. The result of the operation of a logical operator is a Boolean value either true or false. 

```
    (4 != 5) && (4 < 5);     // return true
```
